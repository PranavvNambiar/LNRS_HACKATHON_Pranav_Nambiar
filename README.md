# Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview

This project aims to build an **automated sentiment analysis system** that classifies customer reviews and feedback into **positive, negative, or neutral** sentiments. By leveraging advanced NLP models, this system provides businesses with valuable insights into customer opinions, enabling better decision-making and faster responses to customer concerns.

## Problem Statement

In the digital era, businesses face the challenge of managing large volumes of online reviews and feedback. Manual analysis is inefficient and prone to errors, making it difficult to extract meaningful insights quickly. This project offers a solution through automated sentiment classification, allowing businesses to analyze feedback more accurately and at scale.

## Features

- **Sentiment Classification**: Automatically classify text into positive, negative, or neutral categories.
- **RoBERTa Integration**: Utilizes a pre-trained RoBERTa model for accurate deep learning-based sentiment analysis.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Implements tokenization, stop-word removal, and formatting for clean data input.
- **Visualization**: Provides graphical representations of sentiment trends using tools like Matplotlib or Plotly.
- **Scalability**: Efficiently handles large datasets, making it suitable for high-volume customer reviews.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: Core programming language for the project.
- **RoBERTa**: A state-of-the-art deep learning model for NLP tasks.
- **VADER**: A lexicon-based sentiment analysis tool for comparison.
- **nltk**: Used for text preprocessing and tokenization.
- **transformers**: Library to integrate and work with the RoBERTa model.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn/Plotly**: For visualization of sentiment analysis results.

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset with customer reviews or text data.
2. Preprocess the text data by tokenizing, removing stop words, and formatting it for analysis.
3. Run the RoBERTa model for sentiment classification.
4. Optionally, compare results with VADER sentiment analysis for benchmarking.
5. Visualize the classified sentiment data using the chosen plotting library.
